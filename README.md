# WriteAllWords
 print all words!!!!!!
 
 
 A program that will automatically type all words searched by StartsWith (single lower-case character), Contains (optional string of characters) and Length (integer).  
 <br />Please note that StartsWith and Length are required for search and no error-checking is done. So any invalid input will simply crash the program.  
 <br />All searched words will first be displayed on console then printed after a short delay.
